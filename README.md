# FRC Team 10951 Robot Code

This repository contains the robot code for **FRC Team 10951**, developed for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

## Overview
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/)  
- **Control Method:** Arcade drive using a **PS5 controller**

The current version is a simplified rework of code from a previous SSIS teacher project, making it shorter, cleaner, and easier to build on for future seasons.

## Features
- Two-motor arcade drive control
- PS5 controller mapping for robot movement
- Organized and minimal code structure for easy extension
